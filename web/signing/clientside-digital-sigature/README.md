## ðŸš€ Running the Application

Start the development server with:

```
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

This will launch the app in your default browser at:
http://localhost:3000

## ðŸ“– How It Works

- Load PDF:
  - The default "Good.pdf" is loaded on startup. You can use the file picker to load another document.
- Digital Signature Workflow:
  - Document Hashing: The PDF is hashed using SHA-256.
  - PKCS7 Signature Generation: A digital signature is created using the PKCS7 standard.
  - Server-Side Validation: The signature is sent to a /sign endpoint for processing.
  - Real-Time Feedback: The signature validation status is displayed immediately.


## ðŸ”§ Customization

To customize the digital signing process or toolbar settings, modify the nutrientpdfviewer.jsx component. Adjust the signing callback, toolbar items, or any other behavior to meet your needs.
