# UI Customization example

This is an example for building a custom comment thread UI using the new [customization slots API](https://www.nutrient.io/guides/web/user-interface/ui-customization/introduction/).
It replicates default functionalities of creating, editing and deleting comments.

We use React and [Baseline UI](https://www.nutrient.io/baseline-ui) to make it simpler to build the UI.

Read more on how this example works in [our guide](https://www.nutrient.io/guides/web/user-interface/ui-customization/comment-thread-example/).

## Running the example

You'll need `pnpm` and Node JS installed on your machine.

1. Install dependencies:

```sh
pnpm install
```

2. Run the dev server:

```sh
pnpm run dev
```
