# UI Customization example

This is an example for building a custom comment thread UI using the new [customization slots API](https://www.nutrient.io/guides/web/user-interface/ui-customization/introduction/).
It replicates default functionalities of creating, editing and deleting comments.

We use React and [Baseline UI](https://www.nutrient.io/baseline-ui) to make it simpler to build the UI.
