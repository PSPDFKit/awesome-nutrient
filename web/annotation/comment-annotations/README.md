# Annotation Comments POC

This is a proof-of-concept project showcasing the usage of comment linked to annotations automatically with Nutrient. Please note that this project is built using our latest Nutrient Web SDK CDN.

To get started with this project, follow the instructions below:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd annotation-comments
```

3. Install the project dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```
4. Add the latest CDN version to your index.html

```bash
npm run update-nutrient-version
```

5. Start the development server:

```bash
npm run start
```

That's it! You can now access the application in your browser at http://localhost:8080.
#### Note
Make sure that your system has the global `serve` package installed. You can check if it's already installed by running `serve --version` in your terminal.
